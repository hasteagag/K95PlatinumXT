# K95PlatinumXT
an on screen keyboard with appearance like the Corsair K95 Platinum XT

this project utilizes G33kDude's Neutron Class in AutoHotkey.  His project is linked here:  https://github.com/G33kDude/Neutron.ahk
and is a way to render HTML CSS JS (basically web content) inside IE11 via ActiveX through browser emulation.  It has two way communication allowing for a multitude of projects like this one. I have not incldued Neutron.ahk, but again you can check it out here: https://github.com/G33kDude/Neutron.ahk

Project endeavors to mimic the Corsair K95 Platinum XT(Disclaimer: I am not affiliated with Corsair in any way other than as a fanboy and they make fantastic hardware).

The basis is an HTML file with an orthographic representation of the keyboard as the background, on which DIV elements are drawn in the locations of the pressable keys.  The keys are initially styled with a bland white and blurred box-shadow effect.

The Neutron window after initialization is sized to the keyboard.  The Corsair SDK is also utilized to update the colors on the on screen keyboard's keys to represent the colors on the board (with a reasonable representative fidelity).  A separate brightness control is included on the on screen keyboard separate from the hardware as AFAIK there is no current implementation in the Corsair iCUE SDK (available here:  https://github.com/CorsairOfficial/cue-sdk) to read brightness from the keyboard.  I have provided the source and a compiled EXE but you would need to download the SDK and create a new windows forms project and point the linker and includes to the appropriate directory.  I am unfamiliar with sharing these on Git or the extent to which I am allowed to re distribute the SDK, its better in any event to get it from the source as they periodically update it.

Using the windows API and SendMessage WMPCOPYDATA (with 100% spoon fed assistance from CloakerSmoker on the AHK Discord) we read the RGB values efficiently from the Corsair SDK App that runs alongside this project and gets hidden after running.  AHK detects the instance if it is already running, in order to avoid duplication on new instances or reload.

SDK updates are sent via SendMessage to AHK, and after reading the values, an array is updated, and a function is called to update the styling on the "keys" as well as the faux outer glow via the blurred box shadow CSS.  The Win Lock, Brightness and Profile Switch buttons have been overridden in their functionality in the following manner:

Clicking the Profile Switch button on the OSK will randomly generate the colors and turn off the SDK updater.  

Clicking the Brightness button on the OSK will rotate between what I believe the intensity values are on the corresponding hardware, but they are presently distinct and agnostic of one another.

Clicking the Win Lock button on the OSK will cease updating the colors on the keyboard reducing system overhead as this is a somewhat involved and in efficient task as written.  Efficiencies could be realized by by calling the SDK functions from AHK using DLL call rather than this roundabout method and relying on the windows API, although that appears somewhat complex to implement.

Finally, the steak and potatoes, we need to send events from our key presses on the OSK.  This is a twostep process:

First grab the Hwnd of the currently in focus window prior to display of the OSK.  Under normal circumstances, the keyboard fires to the window with focus, so that is what we intend to replicate.

Second, we grab the key pressed via the event sent to AHK from Neutron (from JavaScript) as its name is roughly associated with the AutoHotkey key name by class name, then to get more specific...and flexible, we have an array of keys that get looped over and matches will mean the user pressed that key and its corresponding key should be emitted, after refocusing the active window.  

Other approaches worth looking at might be ControlSend, so the OSK can stay active, however your mileage may vary as some applications seek keypress messages differently.  With modifiers, we test for their actual presence on the real keyboard, but also allow one second time outs (certainly can be changed to your liking) to register modifiers on the OSK.  We also restart the timer for all modifiers if subsequent modifiers are pressed, as that may be quite tight in multi modifier key combinations.

Some bugs likely exist and feedback is welcome!

Hotkey note:  The only hotkey present is CTRL and tilde/accent-grave/backtick/acute which shows and hides the OSK and stops and starts the key color updater.  This way it should not be burning clocks in the background.  You can change the update rate in the timer if you would like to use fewer system resources - or disable it entirely and you can do so out of the box by clicking the win lock button.
